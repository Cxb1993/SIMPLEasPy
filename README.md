SIMPLEasPy
==========

A bare-bones, lightweight SIMPLE solver. This is intended for a very simple testing platform, in particular for immersed boundary methods (IBM). This code is not very fast. This is mostly a proto-type code, which will later be implemented in C++ for better performance.

Usage:

The SciPy packages, in particular NumPy and Matplotlib, must be installed on the system. These packages are available at

http://www.scipy.org/

The solver can then simply be run by running the script SIMPLEasPy with a Python interpreter. Report any problems on the github page.
